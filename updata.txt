[Fix] Sect Task Claim Button Issue
- Fixed bug where sect task buttons remained disabled (greyed out with "?" tooltip) after claiming reward.
- Root cause: After claiming, only update() was called, which does not re-render the task list when it has content.
- Solution: Changed to call renderTasks() after successful claim, which rebuilds the task cards with correct button states.
