   - Result: Foundation pill now correctly uses maxCount (20), while golden_core_pill and higher use min(maxCount, eraId)

[2026-01-08 21:58] Feature: Sword Maid Numeiko Building (⚔️ 劍侍糯美子)
1. buildings.csv: Added new building "sword_maid" (Era 5, requires: 金錢×100000, 秘銀×200, 寒鐵×200, 中級獸晶×200)

3. BuildingPanel.js: Multi-lingualized "目前上限" (current cap) bottleneck text.
4. en.json: Fixed typo "天聲" -> "天生" for innate dao body talent description.
5. en.json, ja.json: Fixed translation key suffix for "稀有的天道證明..." (Dao Proof description) from ". " to "。" to match HelpPanel usage.

1. MainView.js: Enabled real-time updates for the training progress bar and percentage text in `updatePlayerStatus`.
2. MainView.js: Removed time-based "reason" from the level-up button title (Tooltip) to stop the constant flickering caused by ticking seconds.
3. UI Logic: Now the Tooltip focus on resource requirements (updated less frequently), while the progress bar handles cultivation time visualization.

[2026-01-07 01:05] UI: Level-Up Button Tooltip & Training Progress Bar
1. MainView.js: Level-up button tooltip now shows resource requirements with current/required values and checkmarks.
2. MainView.js: Added a training progress bar (75% width) below the level-up button to show cultivation progress.

2. PlayerManager.js: Added restriction to prevent consuming pills with 'tribulationSuccess' effect (e.g., Foundation Pill) when Era < 3 (Golden Core).
3. PlayerManager.js: Updated pill effect description to show "(Current realm cannot consume)" if the restriction applies.
4. i18n: Added translation for restriction message.

[2026-01-06 23:55] Feature: Enhanced Level Up Button tooltips
1. EraManager.js: Refactored checkLevelUpRequirements to provide detailed feedback when resources are insufficient. It now lists specific missing resource names and amounts.

2. MainView.js: Unified resource source to getUnlockedResources() for both level-up button click and UI updates.
3. Result: Level up button now correctly reflects the satisfied status of resources and training time.

[2026-01-06 23:45] Fix: Realm hint display error in zh-TW
1. LanguageManager.js: Removed zh-TW special case. Now loads zh-TW.json like other languages.

1. EraManager.js: Updated checkLevelUpRequirements to display 'remaining time' instead of 'total required time' when training time is insufficient. This allows the player to see the impact of Spirit Accumulation Pill (which adds cultivation time) as a reduction in remaining time.
2. zh-CN.json: Changed the translation of 'Year' (年) to 'Si' (祀) and updated the insufficient time message to 'Still need {years} Si'.


[2026-01-05 00:54] Fix: getLevelUpRequiredTime logic in EraManager
1. EraManager.js: Fixed getLevelUpRequiredTime logic to use (currentLevel - 1) as exponent, matching the level sequence index (0-based for Level 1). This ensures the returned required time matches the Cumulative Time Threshold for Level 1, aligning with verify logic in checkLevelUpRequirements.
2. Verified unit change in UI via code reviews (Year -> Si).


[2026-01-05 01:10] Fix: Log params interpolation
1. LanguageManager.js: Although the code was correct, confirmed logic for parameter replacement. It uses {0} format or {name} format depending on t() implementation. In zh-CN.json, keys use {0}, {1}. The call in BuildingManager uses {0}, {1} too.
2. BuildingManager.js: The issue 'Building {0} upgraded to Lv.{1}' implies that {0} was NOT replaced. This usually happens if the translation key in JSON uses different placeholders OR if the passed params object key doesn't match.
   Key in zh-CN: '建築 <b>{0}</b> 升級至 Lv.{1}' (needs checking JSON file)
   Code: t('建築 <b>{0}</b> 升級至 Lv.{1}', { '0': ..., '1': ... })
   If zh-TW (default), logic does replace params.
   If zh-CN, logic does replace params IF translated string has {0}, {1}.
   
   Potential cause: The 'zh-CN.json' file might NOT have the key '建築 <b>{0}</b> 升級至 Lv.{1}' exactly, or it might have different placeholders. I should check zh-CN.json for this specific key.
